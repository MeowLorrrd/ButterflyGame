# ButterflyGame


Your goal: collect butterflies! There isn't a whole lot to do currently, but try something like collecting a full stack (30!) of Golden Butterflies!
Collectable butterflies:
	Monarch, an orange-yellow butterfly that commenly shows up
	Nebula, a bright purple butterfly
	Glasswing, a see-through butterfly
	Golden, the rarest of them all!
	
Control your frog-guy:
	'A' to move left
	'D' to move right
	'Space' to jump
	'Left mouse button' to use an item
		If you have a butterfly selected, it will summon it instead
	'1-9' to navigate your hotbar
	'E' to view your full inventory
	'Esc' to exit the game



Items:
	Basic Bug net, swing it around to catch butterflies
	Net bomb, it currently does nothing (and is unobtainable), but throwing it should catch butterflies in an area
	Butterflies, you can collect them or release them into the world
