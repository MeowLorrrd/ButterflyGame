Butterflies:
	

Inventory:
	Make sure items don't get deleted if inventory is full
	
UI:
	Make text system (item names and butterfly names)

Player:
	Increase player's move speed
	Increase player's move speed while jumping
	Create Camera system to allow bigger world

Misc:
	Check for memory leaks or overheads
		idk i feel like 150mb for this game is too much 
			ITS 84mb now! :D
	Memory optimization with Input system
		Instead of pre allocating 200 bools, have vector with active types
		Don't know how bad it will kill performance, as values are assigned to 4 vectors EVERY FRAME
