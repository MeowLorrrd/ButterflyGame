Fix Butterflies flikkering after dying

Make sure Item is not deleted if inventory is full
Increase Inventory Slots to 16 (1 for selected mouse slot)
	Actually do like 4x7 (+1) bc 16 is stupidly low
	Make toggle-able inventory UI, with the disabled state only showing a hotbar

Add fonts (for item stacks)
